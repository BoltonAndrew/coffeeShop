# Coffee Shop CMD App

## Functionality

I have created this app as an example of using the Inquirer and Figlet libraries to coincide with creating local JSON files.

The basic functions are add, list, remove and exit.

1. Add, this function requires and then stores the name of a person, then requires and stores the drink type and size using the name as the other key value pair.
2. List, this function prints the current list of orders stored in the JSON file.
3. Remove, this function asks for a number that corresponds with the list item, it then removes the relevant list item.
4. Exit, this takes the command line out of the application.
